In February of 2019, JP Morgan announced that it would be launching a blockchain-powered digital currency called JPM Coin, a stablecoin that has its value pegged to the U.S. dollar. The goal is to allow their customers, especially among institutional investors, to make instantaneous payments using blockchain-based technology. As Umar Farooq said, head of digital treasury services and blockchain at JP Morgan: 

> Exchanging value, such as money, between different parties over a blockchain requires a digital currency, so we created the JPM Coin.

 JPM Coin is significantly different from cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, for example, it is redeemable at 1:1 ratio for the US dollar. It is relatively easy for investors to use JPM Coin. To begin with, a client has to deposit a lump sum of money in a special account and askes for exchanging correponding JPM coins. Second, these coins can be utilized among different transactions across a blockchain network and with other JPMorgan clients. Last, their JPM coins can be redeemed with the bank to receive U.S. dollars at any moment.


### 2. Business Activities

The specific financial problem that JPMorgan attempts to address is to exchange value between different parties over blockchain. Ultimately, the bank's intended customer is all their clients. However, JPM Coin is still at a early stage, so their targets right now are only institutional investors such as major investment banks. As Farooq stated:

> JPM Coin is currently designed for business-to-business money movement flows, and because we are still in a testing phase, we donâ€™t have plans to make this available to individuals at this stage. That said, the cost-savings and efficiency benefits would extend to the end customers of our institutional clients.

While JPM Coin is similar to other stablecoins, like ![Tether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)), it has a few advantages. First, JPM Coin will only be available with proper permissions whereas other stablecoins are open access and available to the public. This improves the security of transcations made by JPM Coin. Next, it is designed to facilitate the transfer of funds while other coins are seen as investment tools that are subject to risks such as liquidity and speculation. Finally, JPM Coin will always be redeemable in fiat currency leading to much more transparency than many other stablecoins.

JPM Coin runs on a blockchain technology called Quorum, a network J.P. Morgain developed on their own, and it is a private version of the Ethereum network. In order to implement it, clients have to exchange their money for JPM Coins, and then they can use these digital tokens to facilitate transactions over Quorum blockchain.
